Hello, and thanks for stopping by! <br>

My name is Jana. I am passionate about leveraging big data in order to make meaningful business decisions. Originally from the Bay Area, I am currently living in New York City, pursuing my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology & Applied Biostatistics at Columbia University.

In my spare time, I am an avid [Yelp Elite reviewer](https://lalalajanaaa.yelp.com/), a mother of two adorable mini-lop bunnies, [Ellie and Earl Grey 🐰🐰](https://www.instagram.com/ellieandearlgrey/), singles tennis player, and loyal patron of the New York Public Library. <br>
